I am a professor of chemical engineering, specializing in large-scale separation processes based on adsorption, chromatography, and ion exchange.

My AI/ML expertise includes:
- LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs
- Building MCP servers that connect LLMs to simulation software (Fortran, Python)
- Classical ML for process modeling (MLPs, LSTMs)

I'm looking for collaborators who work on:
- Integration of LLMs with domain-specific computational tools
- Neuro-symbolic AI and constraint programming
- Generative AI for scientific applications
- Process systems engineering with AI/ML components

I am NOT interested in:
- Pure materials synthesis/development
- Analytical chemistry applications
- Biopharmaceutical/bioprocess focus

Ideal collaboration: Someone who builds similar infrastructure (LLM + solver/simulator integration) but in a different domain, allowing methodology transfer.
